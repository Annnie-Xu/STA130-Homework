    "1. Question 1: How does relationship status impact life satisfaction among respondents?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - WELLNESS_life_satisfaction: This variable measures respondents' life satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 10, with higher values indicating greater satisfaction. It is a discrete numerical variable. A histogram will help visualize the distribution of life satisfaction scores across the sample, showing whether responses are skewed, centered, or bimodal. This insight is useful to assess whether most people report high, low, or mixed levels of satisfaction, which might shape our expectations when analyzing differences by relationship status.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     - DEMO_relationship_status: This is a categorical variable that records respondents' relationship status. It includes multiple suboridinating variables: DEMO_relationship_status_single,  DEMO_relationship_status_dating, DEMO_relationship_status_relationship, DEMO_relationship_status_widowed, DEMO_relationship_status_divorced, DEMO_relationship_status_separated, \tDEMO_relationship_status_married, DEMO_relationship_status_common_law. A bar plot will display the frequency of each relationship status category. This visualization gives an overview of how many respondents fall into each category, which will be important when comparing life satisfaction across group.\n",
    "          \n",
    "3. Method: Two-Sample t-tests for pairs of relationship status groups (Since we are comparing life satisfaction across relationship status categories, we can use two-sample t-tests between pairs of groups to test for differences in means.) Detailed Steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "     - Remove rows where WELLNESS_life_satisfaction or DEMO_relationship_status is missing to ensure a complete dataset.\n",
    "        \n",
    "      - Calculate the mean and standard deviation of WELLNESS_life_satisfaction for each relationship status group as a preliminary look at group differences.\n",

    "        \n",
    "      - Two-Sample t-tests:Conduct pairwise two-sample t-tests between relationship status groups (e.g., Married vs. Single, In a relationship vs. Single) to determine if there are statistically significant differences in mean life satisfaction between each pair. Interpret the p-values from each test to decide whether the observed differences are statistically significant.\n",
    "        \n",

    "    - Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in life satisfaction between each pair of relationship statuses (e.g., Married vs. Single).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in life satisfaction between each pair of relationship statuses.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Expected Results: If we observe p-values below 0.05 for any pairs, we would conclude that there is a significant difference in life satisfaction between those relationship status groups. For instance, if life satisfaction is significantly higher for married individuals compared to single individuals, it could indicate the potential positive impact of marriage on well-being.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Relevance of Results: Significant findings would suggest that relationship status plays a role in life satisfaction, supporting the notion that social relationships contribute to well-being. Insights from this analysis could help promote the importance of supportive partnerships for improving happiness."

For example, a positive slope would indicate that life satisfaction tends to increase with age, while a negative slope would suggest a decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Relevance of Results: Understanding whether life satisfaction changes with age could offer insights into how different life stages impact well-being. For instance, if older individuals report higher satisfaction, this might suggest that stability or life experience enhances well-being. Findings could inform age-specific well-being initiatives or policies."
